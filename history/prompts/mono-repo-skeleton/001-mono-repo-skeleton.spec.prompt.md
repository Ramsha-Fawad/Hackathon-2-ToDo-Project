## Prompt

Evolution of Todo – Mono Repo Skeleton Generation

Target audience:

Hackathon developers and AI agents using Claude Code to generate a spec-driven project structure.

Focus:

Generate a Mono Repo folder structure for all 5 phases of the Evolution of Todo project.

Include standard subfolders and placeholder files to support Spec-Driven Development workflow.

Ensure the structure is modular, consistent, and ready for Phase I–V development, including AI agents and deployment scripts for later phases.

Success criteria:

Repository root contains:

CONSTITUTION.md – Project Constitution

README.md – Placeholder setup instructions

CLAUDE.md – Instructions for Claude Code usage

/specs_history/ – Folder to store all feature specs

/src/ – Source code folder

Each Phase folder exists under /phases/ (or /src/phases/ if preferred) with subfolders:

PhaseI/ – In-Memory Python CLI

PhaseII/ – Full-Stack Web App

PhaseIII/ – AI-Powered Chatbot

PhaseIV/ – Local Kubernetes Deployment

PhaseV/ – Advanced Cloud Deployment

Each Phase folder contains:

/specs/ – Phase-specific Specs

/src/ – Phase-specific source code

/tests/ – Unit and integration test placeholders

Optional README.md explaining the phase

Placeholder files generated where appropriate to avoid empty folders (e.g., .gitkeep, initial spec markdowns)

All folders ready for Claude Code to populate with feature specs and implementations

Constraints:

Must follow Python project structure conventions for Phase I, web conventions for Phase II, and AI/deployment conventions for later phases.

Folder names must be consistent, lowercase, and hyphenated if multiple words (e.g., phase_i)

All content placeholders must be minimal but valid Markdown or Python syntax where applicable.

No manual folder creation; entire structure must be generated by Claude Code from this spec.

Not building:

Actual feature implementations

AI chatbots or cloud deployments at this stage

Databases or persistent storage

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive specification for the Mono Repo Skeleton Generation feature. The specification includes:

- Three user stories prioritized by importance:
  1. Hackathon Developer Sets Up Project Structure (P1)
  2. AI Agent Generates Code from Specs (P2)
  3. Developer Navigates Multi-Phase Project (P3)

- Five functional requirements covering the core structure needs
- Three key entities (Phase Directory Structure, Skeleton Files, Documentation Files)
- Five measurable success criteria focusing on navigation, completeness, and AI agent compatibility
- Two edge cases addressing empty directories and technology stack differences

The specification is written in a technology-agnostic way, focusing on user value and business needs rather than implementation details. All mandatory sections are completed and the specification is ready for the planning phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete specification for mono repo skeleton structure supporting 5-phase todo app evolution
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements checklist in specs/001-mono-repo-skeleton/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to proceed with /sp.plan to design implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully captures the structural requirements for the multi-phase todo app evolution.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - all requirements met
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin planning implementation of the skeleton structure
